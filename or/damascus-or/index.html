            <p>Damascus /dəˈmæskɪs/ is a census-designated place and former city in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. Established in 1867, it was incorporated in 2004 in an effort to enable local land use decision-making control by the community. Its residents voted to disincorporate in 2016, and, after a legal challenge, its disincorporation was completed in 2020. Damascus is located east of Happy Valley and Interstate 205 and west of Boring. The population was 10,539 residents as of the 2010 census.</p>
