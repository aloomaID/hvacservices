            <h3>Millbourne, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Millbourne was settled by Samuel Sellers in 1682. Samuel's descendants later owned a gristmill in Millbourne called Millbourne Mills. In the early 1900s, developers Samuel Shoemaker and John L. Fry developed housing in Millbourne, leading to its separation from Upper Darby and its official incorporation as a borough in 1909. Millbourne Mills shut down in 1926 and was replaced by a Sears, Roebuck & Co. store, which operated until 1988 when it relocated to Upper Darby, causing financial strain on Millbourne. Millbourne was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1998 and was removed from the list in 2014.</p>
